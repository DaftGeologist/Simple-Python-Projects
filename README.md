# Simple-Python-Projects
  Here are a few programs I learned in an intro to Python class I took in early 2017. They are all very basic exercises about looping, searching and functions. Maybe someone will find them useful.

  Basically, if you run the programs, you will see the result. The file names and instructions in the code itself
are the only explanation offered as to the purpose of the programs. This is a repository of 'challanges'.
Take a gander and practice your ability to interpret code. None of these examples are particularly difficult to understand, but offer a nice introduction into python's procedural paradigm.

  Any contributions or suggestions are welcome. Otherwise, this will simply live here
on Github in whatever manner suits the code gods. It is also an introduction for me to the use of Github.
