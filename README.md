# Simple-Python-Projects
  Here are a few programs I learned in an intro to Python class I took in early 2017. They are all very basic exercises about looping, searching and functions. Maybe someone will find them useful.

  Basically, if you run the programs, you will see the result. The titles are and instructions in the code itself
are the only explanation offered as the the purpose of the programs. I think of this of a repository of 'challanges'.
Anyone can take a gander at these examples, and practice reading and following the path of the code to the end result.
None of these examples are difficult to understand of course.

  This project is as much an indtroduction to github for me, as it is any kind of contribution to the effect of what
I've described above. Any contributions or suggestions are absolutely welcome. Otherwise, this will simply live here
on github happily, and in whatever manner suits the code gods.
